"Great! Let's break down your sentence step by step.
Sentence Breakdown Table (First 3 rows)
| English	| Spanish
| I've	| Yo he
| missed	| extrañado
| you	| a ti / te
| Sentence | Structure

[Subject][verb][object]

    Subject: "I" is implied in the verb conjugation and typically omitted in Spanish.
    Verb: "Missed" (in the past tense, which is important to capture here).
    Object: "You" is a direct object, so think about how to express "you" as a direct object (formal vs informal).

Clues:

    "I've" is a contraction of "I have," so think about the present perfect form in Spanish.
    "Missed" is the past participle "extrañado," but make sure to apply the right auxiliary verb for the present perfect tense.
    The word "yesterday" indicates a past action, but in Spanish, we usually don’t need to translate "yesterday" directly into the sentence.
    The object "you" can be expressed as either "a ti" (informal) or "te" (direct object pronoun), depending on the level of formality.
    Spanish often omits the subject pronoun, especially when it's clear from the conjugation.

Notes:

    The present perfect in Spanish often uses "haber" (he) + past participle ("extrañado").
    When expressing "I miss you" or similar sentiments, use the verb "extrañar" in Spanish.
    For past events, "ayer" (yesterday) is often added to provide context, but it doesn’t always need to be part of the sentence.
    Make sure to use the correct form of the direct object pronoun ("te" or "a ti").
    The subject pronoun "yo" can usually be omitted since it's understood through conjugation.

Now, give it a try! I'll evaluate your translation."

- Here's an example with a scoring of 9 out of 10:

"Sentence Breakdown Table (First 3 rows)
| English	| Spanish
| We	| Nosotros
| didn't	| no
| find	| encontrar
Sentence Structure:

    We didn't find what we were looking for follows a typical structure of negation + verb + object in Spanish. Make sure to use the appropriate tense and consider the negation placement.

Clues:

    The subject "we" translates to Nosotros, but in informal contexts, you may omit it as it's implied by the verb conjugation.
    "Didn't" is no, used to negate the verb.
    "Find" is encontrar; consider the verb form (past tense) that matches the context.
    The phrase what we were looking for translates to a relative clause that can be tricky. Think about how to express "what" as a direct object in Spanish.
    The verb looking implies a past action, so think about how to convey this in the correct tense.

Notes:

    In Spanish, negation often comes right before the verb, so the "no" would go directly before encontramos.
    The verb buscar means "to look for," and here you need the past continuous form of the verb to reflect "we were looking for."
    "What we were looking for" is a relative clause, and it's translated using lo que for a neutral object.
    In spoken Spanish, it's common to omit the subject pronoun nosotros because the verb conjugation already tells us the subject.
    Make sure to use the correct past tense conjugation for both the action of finding and looking.

Now, give your translation a try! I'll evaluate it for you."

- Here's an example with a scoring of 8 out of 10: 

"Sentence Breakdown Table
| English	| Spanish| 
Clues:

    "The" in Spanish translates to "El" (for masculine) or "La" (for feminine) depending on the noun.
    "Dog" is "perro" in Spanish, and it's a masculine noun.
    "Jumped" is "saltó", the past tense form of the verb "saltar".
    "Fence" is "cerca" in Spanish, and it's a feminine noun, so we use "la" before it.
    Pay attention to the word order in Spanish—it generally follows a similar structure to English (Subject + Verb + Object).

Notes:

    Remember that in Spanish, nouns are gendered (either masculine or feminine). Here, "perro" (dog) is masculine, and "cerca" (fence) is feminine.
    "Saltó" is a simple past verb, so you will use it for actions completed in the past.
    Spanish often uses definite articles ("el," "la") in front of nouns, even when English doesn’t.
    In some cases, the subject pronoun (like "the" or "I") can be dropped in Spanish because the verb conjugation indicates the subject.
    Word order remains relatively the same in this case, but always watch for sentence structure as Spanish can sometimes invert word order for emphasis.

Now, it's your turn! Try translating the sentence, and I'll evaluate your answer."
