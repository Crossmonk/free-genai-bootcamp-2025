"Sentence Breakdown Table
| English	| Spanish
| The dog	| El perro
| jumped	| saltar
| the fence	| la cerca
Clues:

    "The" in Spanish translates to "El" (for masculine) or "La" (for feminine) depending on the noun.
    "Dog" is "perro" in Spanish, and it's a masculine noun.
    "Jumped" is "saltó", the past tense form of the verb "saltar".
    "Fence" is "cerca" in Spanish, and it's a feminine noun, so we use "la" before it.
    Pay attention to the word order in Spanish—it generally follows a similar structure to English (Subject + Verb + Object).

Notes:

    Remember that in Spanish, nouns are gendered (either masculine or feminine). Here, "perro" (dog) is masculine, and "cerca" (fence) is feminine.
    "Saltó" is a simple past verb, so you will use it for actions completed in the past.
    Spanish often uses definite articles ("el," "la") in front of nouns, even when English doesn’t.
    In some cases, the subject pronoun (like "the" or "I") can be dropped in Spanish because the verb conjugation indicates the subject.
    Word order remains relatively the same in this case, but always watch for sentence structure as Spanish can sometimes invert word order for emphasis.

Now, it's your turn! Try translating the sentence, and I'll evaluate your answer."
